FRACTINT for OS/2 Presentation Manager

PMFRACT release 2.0 uses the fractal calculation engine of FRACTINT for DOS
release 15.1.  As such, there is more function in that code than is
currently exposed to the user in the Presentation Manager interface
that I have written.  This is because my interest was in learning
OS/2 Presentation Manager and SAA/CUA user interfaces, as well as
the pretty pictures, and I have learned about as much as I can tolerate
for the time being.  However, I expect to get the "bug" again and intend
to pick up PMFRACT again in the near future.  For the time being,
this is my list of where I will probably be heading next.

- 3-D and 3-D Overlay - The code to do much of this is in the fractal
  engine code and just not exposed to the user interface, mostly because
  I have written as may dialog boxes as I can currently tolerate.

- Color Cycling - This is mostly a Presentation Manager limitation at the
  moment.  Palettes don't change on the basic 16-color VGA OS/2 systems.
  Hotter hardware, like the 8514/A display card, support palette changing,
  but the results are neither particularly fast or particularly pretty
  (you change the physical palette for everybody without any notification).
  Future OS/2 levels are supposed to have palette manager support, much like
  what is now in Windows 3.0, and I will readdress this issue then.

- Real OS/2-style Help - PMFRACT started to grow when OS/2 1.1 was the
  current version, which did not have a documented Help system.
  So, I wrote my own called SMPLHELP (Simple Help system).
  OS/2 1.2 and 1.3 (and I assume 2.x and x.x in the future) do,
  but I have not yet learned it.  This I intend to address soon as an
  excuse to learn about the OS/2 1.2 and up Help system.

- Release 16.0 fractal engine - This I will probably address as soon as
  I can get the code.
