FRACTINT for OS/2 Presentation Manager

PMFRACT is distributed as follows:

READ.ME       the basic documentation file
*.DOC         other documentation, of which this file is one of them
PMFRACT.EXE   the main executable file
SMPLHELP.DLL  support subroutines - Simple Help manager
OPENDLG.DLL   support subroutines - file Open/Save dialogs
*.L           L-System parameters from FRACTINT for DOS
*.FRM         Formulas from FRACTINT for DOS
*.IFS         Iterated Function System files from FRACTINT for DOS
*.MAP         Palette map files - most from FRACTINT for DOS

To be able to run PMFRACT, you must put files SMPLHELP.DLL and OPENDLG.DLL
in a subdirectory that is listed in the LIBPATH= parameter in you OS/2
CONFIG.SYS file.  If you have created a subdirectory for your own tools
and toys and listed it in the LIBPATH, it would be best to put them there.
That is the approach I take for my own system.  If you have not added
a subdirectory for your own DLL files, or you do not have the slightest
idea what I am talking about here, then copy SMPLHELP.DLL and OPENDLG.DLL
to C:\OS2\DLL, which is the subdirectory where OS/2 himself puts his
support subroutine files.  Failure to do this will usually result in
the following error message on attempting to start PMFRACT:
    SYS1804: The system cannot find the file .
Note that OS/2 is actually attempting to tell you "I cannot find OPENDLG.DLL"
or "I cannot find SMPLHELP.DLL" but is unsuccessful in doing so.
Note that the LIBPATH is separate from the PATH for finding executable
files, and can only be changed by altering CONFIG.SYS and re-booting.

The other files are best put all together in the subdirectory of your
choice.

PMFRACT may be started just by saying PMFRACT.  All command line
arguments documented for release 15.1 or FRACTINT for DOS are legal,
but some are ignored (such as VIDEO= and BATCH=).
For example, PMFRACT TYPE=MANDEL CORNERS=-0.726288/-0.721912/0.284798/0.288085
draws my favorite area of the Mandelbrot set.
