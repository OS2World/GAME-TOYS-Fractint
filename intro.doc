Introduction

FRACTINT plots and manipulates images of "objects" -- actually, sets of
mathematical points -- that have fractal dimension. See chapter 9 for
some historical and mathematical background on fractal geometry, a
discipline named and popularized by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. For
now, these sets of points have three important properties:

1) They are generated by relatively simple calculations repeated over
and over, feeding the results of each step back into the next --
something computers can do very rapidly.

2) They are, quite literally, infinitely complex: they reveal more and
more detail without limit as you plot smaller and smaller areas.
Fractint lets you "zoom in" by positioning a small box and hitting
<Enter> to redraw the boxed area at full-screen size; its maximum linear
"magnification" is over a trillionfold.

3) They can be astonishingly beautiful, especially using PC color
displays' ability to assign colors to selected points, and (with VGA
displays or EGA in 640x350x16 mode) to "animate" the images by quickly
shifting those color assignments.

The name FRACTINT was chosen because the program generates many of its
images using INTeger math, rather than the floating point calculations
used by most such programs. That means that you don't need a math co-
processor chip (aka floating point unit or FPU), although for a few
fractal types where floating point math is faster, the program
recognizes and automatically uses an 80x87 chip if it's present. It's
even faster on systems using Intel's 80386 and 80486 microprocessors,
where the integer math can be executed in their native 32-bit mode.

Fractint works with many adapters and graphics modes from CGA to the
1024x768, 256-color 8514/A mode. Even "larger" images, up to
2048x2048x256, can be plotted to expanded memory, extended memory, or
disk: this bypasses the screen and allows you to create images with
higher resolution than your current display can handle, and to run in
"background" under multi-tasking control programs such as DESQview and
Windows 3.

Fractint is an experiment in collaboration. Many volunteers have joined
Bert Tyler, the program's first author, in improving successive
versions. Through electronic mail messages, first on CompuServe's PICS
forum and now on COMART, new versions are hacked out and debugged a
little at a time. Fractint was born fast, and none of us has seen any
other fractal plotter close to the present version for speed,
versatility, and all-around wonderfulness. (If you have, tell us so we
can steal somebody else's ideas instead of each other's.) See Appendix B
for information about the authors and how to contribute your own ideas
and code.

Fractint for Presentation Manager was adapted from Fractint-for-DOS
by Donald P. Egen, CIS ID 73507,3143.
This program was a training exercize in Presentation Manager
and SAA programming,
which goes a long way towards explaining a lot of the bugs.
My task was made a lot easier by Pieter Branderhorst, who separated the
MSDOS-specific code from Fractint-for-DOS's fractal generator modules,
and the efforts of Bert Tyler in porting Fractint-for-DOS to
Windows.
By noting what Bert had to do to get the fractal generator running
under Windows, and the user interface functionality needed for the
Windows environment, I was able to create a Presentation Manager
user interface that could adaquately drive the fractal generator.
Besides, I like looking at the pretty pictures.

Fractint for Presentation Manager is based heavily on (and uses the fractal generator
engines straight out of) Fractint-for-DOS.  A partial list of the authors
of Fractint-for-DOS includes:
